***Academic Research Data Management System ‚Äî WITH DATABASE***
 
The Academic Research Data Management System is designed to simplify the process of managing, analyzing, and visualizing research data.
It enables users to fetch research papers from the arXiv API, organize them, and store essential details in Firebase Firestore for long-term management and access.

**‚öôÔ∏è Features**

- Fetch academic papers directly from arXiv using keywords or author names.

- Store metadata such as title, abstract, authors, and publication date.

- Visualize publication trends over time using Plotly.

- Maintain a Firestore database for storing and retrieving research data.

- Simple and interactive Gradio interface for usability.
